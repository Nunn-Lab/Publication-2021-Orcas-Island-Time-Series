R Markdown file (.Rmd) includes code to make all figures found in the manuscript.
The convention for the naming of the metagenomic sequencing files follows this pattern:
- ORCAS_bact_20210604_08_21
- ORCAS = location
- bact = sample type /size fraction 0.22-1.0 um
- 20210604 is the date the sample was collected YYYYMMDD
- 08= Day 8 is the day number of the 22 days that the sample was collected (starts at day 1; ends day 22)
- 21 = 21:00 is the time the sample was collected (samples were collected every 4 hours)

YSI probe data was collected on 10 minute intervals
