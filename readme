#The convention for the naming of the metagenomic sequencing files follows this pattern:
 #ORCAS_bact_20210604_08_21
#ORCAS = location
#bact = sample type /size fraction 0.22-1.0 um
#20210604 is the date the sample was collected YYYYMMDD
#08= Day 8 is the day number of the 22 days that the sample was collected (starts at day 1; ends day 22)
#21 = 21:00 is the time the sample was collected (samples were collected every 4 hours)

#YSI probe data was collected on 10 minute intervals
